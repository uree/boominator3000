Fetches Bandcamp albums featured in Tolpa Bumov on Radio Å tudent and arranges them in a quasi playlist.


## Run

Download the repository and run for boom-fetch (linux) or boom-fetch.exe (wins).

Go to http://localhost:8090/tolpe?from=2021-10-20.

The `from` parameter is mandatory. The required date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Other query string parameters are `to (YYYY-MM-DD)` and `update (default false)`. If update is set to true,

http://localhost:8090/tolpe?from=2021-10-20&update=true

the list of albums is refreshed ie. fetched from radiostudent.si anew.

You can add an album to your favourites by clicking on the star. Inspect your favourites at

http://localhost:8090/fav
